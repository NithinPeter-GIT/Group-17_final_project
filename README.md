Abstract
In this project we present an innovative way to detect ships in the ocean using SAR image. Detection of ships is complicated, especially under unfavourable conditions, such as during night-time or on cloudy days. Locations of ships in the ocean can be useful in many situations like finding route,search & rescue, surveillance, fisheries management, etc.

Our objective is to create a method that can use SAR images to detect a ship's location and also its size. It will help us to find out ship hotspots and also find optimal maritime routes. It can help in accurately locating ships in case of emergency for search and rescue operations. Having a real time location of ships can be very helpful for many operations.
